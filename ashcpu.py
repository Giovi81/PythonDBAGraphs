ashcpu.py

Generates a graph that shows cpu usage within an Oracle database
by various parts of the application. The graph is configured by lines in 
the text file ashcpufile.txt.

Each line is part of a client machine name and a label
for machines with that pattern.

For example:

abcd WEBFARM

Any client machines with the string abcd in their name 
will have their database cpu usage grouped into the category WEBFARM.

The graph is hard coded to only look at CPU usage between 8 am and 5 pm
of the day of the week specified. This is intended to look at CPU usage
during the work day.

Example of the type of query that cpubymachine class builds:

select * from 
(
select
CASE 
WHEN  UPPER(MACHINE) like '%webhost%'  THEN 'WEBFARM'
WHEN  UPPER(MACHINE) like '%mobhost%'  THEN 'MOBILE'
ELSE 'OTHER' END labels,
to_char(sample_time,'YYYY-MM-DD') WEDNESDAY_DATE,
(count(*)*10)/(10*3600*(select to_number(value) from v$parameter where name='cpu_count')) percent_cpu
from DBA_HIST_ACTIVE_SESS_HISTORY

working hours grouping by machine names. It shows which group of 
database clients are consuming the most database cpu resources.

day_history expects the query to have a column named
MONDAY_DATE, TUESDAY_DATE, etc. See comments before cpubymachine
for example of query that would be passed to day_history's init function.

day_history uses two tables per week day with this naming standard:
    
MONDAYASHCPUBYMACHINE_PERM
MONDAYASHCPUBYMACHINE_TEMP

In this example day is MONDAY and queryname is ASHCPUBYMACHINE.

The _TEMP table saves the output of the query. The query retrieves
the given day's AWR information.

The _PERM table saves this information long term. So, if your site keeps
the 7 days of AWR history the _TEMP table will have 7 days of information
but _PERM will have history as far back as the first run of the query.

It is intended that the query be run daily to monitor performance and that
_PERM will grow and have entries for every day.
